# Web3 Madrid

## Project Description
**Madrid's Community Foster Grant**

We are Ethereum Madrid's Meetup members. We intend to leverage our community to foster Web3, Polkadot, and Substrate into the general spanish-speaking community. Meetups, events and courses will be given with both approaches: technical and business related. We believe it is only by the combination of these two than the Web3 ecosystem could flourish.

Our team has followed Polkadot since the very beginning, along with the growth of decentralized technologies. The plan is creating a new Meetup community, with focus in Web3 technologies.

We also have had several appearances in national TV (TVE, TVE 24h), written press (El País, El Confidencial), online press (El Español, Cryptonoticias, SmartsGrid.info), and national radio (Capital Radio).

We also contributed to the technical difusion of Ethereum in the spanish-speaking community, creating the official [Solidity documentation in Spanish](https://solidity-es.readthedocs.io/es/latest)

## Intended language of development
* Spanish :)


There are almost no articles about web3 in Spanish, and we will improve the repository of articles and documents for the spanish-speaking community worldwide.

## Development Roadmap
We will require 6 months to complete this project. We are to organize several meetups, both biz and tech, aligned with the most recent news and development in the ecosystem.

Bi-monthly planning:
- 1 Full event - Choosing a topic and delivering a full presentation with two or three speakers.
- 1 Course - 'From Zero to Hero' general blockchain course with one block fully related to Web3, Parity and Polkadot (out of 4 blocks: Bitcoin, Ecosystem, Cryptoeconomics & Web3).
- 1 Workshop - for developers to extend reach and knowledge of the technology and product managers to prototype web3 solutions.
- 2 Mini event - For beginners, crypto&beers style, to get along with the community and keep it fresh and alive.
- 4 blog articles - both technical and business related, in Spanish. How to participate in the ICO, technical updates, dapps proposals, etc.

To host and foster the open community, we will create a dedicated webpage and a meetup group so that anyone is invited to read and join.

Everything will be documented and accessible in an open source fashion.

The budget we require for those events (15 events in total during 6 months + articles) is attached. It covers all events and documents, plus some General Administrative costs for travel to surrounding cities (León, Valencia, Málaga).

Ideally, we can receive half the funds in Dots in a multisigned wallet to kick off, and receive the other half on completion.
